## Caveats

- Unless specifically stated, the phrase `Amazon EKS cluster` or just `cluster` throughout this document typically refers to the control plane.
- In-place cluster upgrades can only be upgraded to the next incremental minor version. For example, you can upgrade from Kubernetes version 1.20 to 1.21, but not from 1.20 to 1.22.
- Reverting an upgrade, or downgrading the Kubernetes version of a cluster, is not supported. If you upgrade your cluster to a new Kubernetes version and then want to revert to the previous version, you must create a new cluster and migrate your workloads.
- If the Amazon EKS cluster primary security group has been deleted, the only course of action to upgrade is to create a new cluster and migrate your workloads.
    - The following should return the details of the cluster primary security group. If not, the security group may no longer exist:

        ```sh
        aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids $(aws eks describe-cluster --name <CLUSTER_NAME> \
            --query 'cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.clusterSecurityGroupId' --output text)
        ```

Before upgrading, review the following resources for affected changes in the next version of Kubernetes:

## Pre-Upgrade

1. Before updating your control plane to a new Kubernetes version, ensure that the Kubernetes minor version of data plane nodes are the same as your control plane's version.

    Control plane Kubernetes version:
    ```sh
    kubectl version --short
    ```

    Nodes Kubernetes version:
    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>üìå Example</summary>

    Control plane Kubernetes version:

    ```sh
    kubectl version --short

    # Output
    Server Version: v1.21.14-eks-fb459a0
    ```

    Nodes Kubernetes version:

    ```sh
    NAME                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
    ip-10-0-4-19.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   4h22m   v1.20.15-eks-abc64b1 ‚ùå # Needs to be upgraded first
    ip-10-0-4-23.ec2.internal   Ready    <none>   4h24m   v1.21.14-eks-fb459a0 ‚úÖ # Ready to upgrade
    ```

    </details>

2. Verify that there are at least 5 free IPs in the VPC subnets used by the control plane. Amazon EKS creates new elastic network interfaces (ENIs) in any of the subnets specified for the control plane. If there are not enough available IPs, then the upgrade will fail (your control plane will stay on the prior version).

    ```sh
    aws ec2 describe-subnets --subnet-ids $(aws eks describe-cluster --name <CLUSTER_NAME> \
      --query 'cluster.resourcesVpcConfig.subnetIds' --output text) --query 'Subnets[*].AvailableIpAddressCount'
    ```

3. Ensure the security groups allow the necessary cluster communication. The new control plane network interfaces may be created in different subnets than what your existing control plane network interfaces are in, so make sure that your security group rules allow the [required cluster communication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/sec-group-reqs.html) for any of the subnets that you specified when you created your cluster.

4. Check Kubernetes API version prerequisites and ensure any removed APIs in the next version are updated prior to upgrading the cluster. There are several open source tools that can help you identify deprecated API versions in your Kubernetes manifests. The following open source projects support scanning both your cluster as well as manifest files to identify deprecated and/or removed API versions:

    - https://github.com/FairwindsOps/pluto
    - https://github.com/doitintl/kube-no-trouble
    - https://github.com/rikatz/kubepug

5. Ensure workloads and applications running on the cluster are setup for high-availability to minimize and avoid disruption during the upgrade process.

    - For stateless workloads
        - Specify multiple replicas for your [replica set(s)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
        - Specify [pod disruption budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/) for replica sets
    - For stateful workloads

## Upgrade

The order of operations to upgrade an Amazon EKS cluster can be summarized as:

- [Upgrade the control plane](#upgrade-the-control-plane)
- [Upgrade the data plane](#upgrade-the-data-plane)
- [Upgrade addons](#upgrade-addons)

### Upgrade the Control Plane

When upgrading the control plane, Amazon EKS performs standard infrastructure and readiness health checks for network traffic on the new control plane nodes to verify that they're working as expected. If any of these checks fail, Amazon EKS reverts the infrastructure deployment, and your cluster control plane remains on the prior Kubernetes version. Running applications aren't affected, and your cluster is never left in a non-deterministic or unrecoverable state. Amazon EKS regularly backs up all managed clusters, and mechanisms exist to recover clusters if necessary.

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Updating an Amazon EKS cluster Kubernetes version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/update-cluster.html)

1. Upgrade the control plane to the next Kubernetes minor version:

    ```sh
    aws eks update-cluster-version --name <CLUSTER_NAME> --kubernetes-version 1.24
    ```

2. Wait for the control plane to finish upgrading before proceeding with any further modifications. The cluster status will change to `ACTIVE` once the upgrade is complete.

    ```sh
    aws eks describe-cluster --name <CLUSTER_NAME> --query 'cluster.status'
    ```

### Upgrade the Data Plane

#### Fargate Profile

- ‚ÑπÔ∏è [Fargate pod patching](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-pod-patching.html)

Note: Fargate profiles are immutable and therefore cannot be changed. However, you can create a new, updated profile to replace an existing profile, and then delete the original. Adding the Kubernetes version to your Fargate profile names will allow you to have one profile name mapped to each version to facilitate upgrades across versions without name conflicts.

1. Create a new Fargate profile(s) with the desired Kubernetes version in the profile name

    ```sh
    aws eks create-fargate-profile --cluster-name <CLUSTER-NAME> \
      --fargate-profile-name <FARGATE-PROFILE-NAME>-1.24 --pod-execution-role-arn <POD-EXECUTION-ROLE-ARN>
    ```

‚ö†Ô∏è Amazon EKS uses the [Eviction API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/api-eviction/) to safely drain the pod while respecting the pod disruption budgets that you set for the application(s).

‚ö†Ô∏è To limit the number of pods that are down at one time when pods are patched, you can set pod disruption budgets (PDBs). You can use PDBs to define minimum availability based on the requirements of each of your applications while still allowing updates to occur. For more information, see [Specifying a Disruption Budget for your Application](To limit the number of pods that are down at one time when pods are patched, you can set pod disruption budgets (PDBs). You can use PDBs to define minimum availability based on the requirements of each of your applications while still allowing updates to occur. For more information, see Specifying a Disruption Budget for your Application in the Kubernetes Documentation.) in the Kubernetes Documentation.
