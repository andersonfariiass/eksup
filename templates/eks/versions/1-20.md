For more information about Kubernetes `1.20`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/08/kubernetes-1-20-release-announcement/).

- `1.20` brings new default roles and users. You can find more information in [Default EKS Kubernetes roles and users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/default-roles-users.html). Ensure that you are using a [supported cert-manager version](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/supported-releases/).

The following Kubernetes features are now supported in Kubernetes `1.20` Amazon EKS clusters:

- [API Priority and Fairness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/) has reached beta status and is enabled by default. This allows `kube-apiserver` to categorize incoming requests by priority levels.
- [RuntimeClass](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/) has reached stable status. The `RuntimeClass` resource provides a mechanism for supporting multiple runtimes in a cluster and surfaces information about that container runtime to the control plane.
- [Process ID Limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pid-limiting/) has now graduated to general availability.
- [kubectl debug](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/) has reached beta status. `kubectl debug` supports common debugging workflows directly from `kubectl`.
- The Docker container runtime has been phased out. The Kubernetes community has written a [blog post](https://blog.k8s.io/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) about this in detail with a dedicated [FAQ page](https://blog.k8s.io/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/). Docker-produced images can continue to be used and will work as they always have. You can safely ignore the `dockershim` deprecation warning message printed in `kubelet` startup logs. Amazon EKS will eventually move to `containerd` as the runtime for the Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. You can follow the containers roadmap [issue](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/313#issuecomment-831617671) for more details.
- Pod Hostname as FQDN has graduated to beta status. This feature allows setting a podâ€™s hostname to its Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), giving the ability to set the hostname field of the kernel to the FQDN of a pod.
- The client-go credential plugins can now be passed in the current cluster information via the `KUBERNETES_EXEC_INFO` environment variable. This enhancement allows Go clients to authenticate using external credential providers, such as a key management system (KMS).
