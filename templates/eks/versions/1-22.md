Kubernetes `1.22` is now available in Amazon EKS. For more information about Kubernetes `1.22`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/04/kubernetes-1-22-release-announcement/).

- Kubernetes `1.22` removes a number of APIs that are no longer available. You might need to make changes to your application before you upgrade to Amazon EKS version `1.22`. Follow the [Kubernetes version `1.22` prerequisites](update-cluster.md#update-1.22) carefully before updating your cluster.
- **Important**
  [https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/542](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/542) graduated to stable and enabled by default in Kubernetes version `1.22`. This feature improves security of service account tokens. It allows workloads that are running on Kubernetes to request JSON web tokens that are audience, time, and key bound. Service account tokens now have an expiration of one hour. In previous Kubernetes versions, they didn't have an expiration. This means that clients that rely on these tokens must refresh the tokens within an hour. The following [Kubernetes client SDKs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/) refresh tokens automatically within the required timeframe:
  Go version `0.15.7` and later
  Python version `12.0.0` and later
  Java version `9.0.0` and later
  JavaScript version `0.10.3` and later
  Ruby `master` branch
  Haskell version `0.3.0.0`
  C# version `7.0.5` and later
  If your workload is using an older client version, then you must update it. To enable a smooth migration of clients to the newer time-bound service account tokens, Kubernetes version `1.22` adds an extended expiry period to the service account token over the default one hour. For Amazon EKS clusters, the extended expiry period is 90 days. Your Amazon EKS cluster's Kubernetes API server rejects requests with tokens older than 90 days. We recommend that you check your applications and their dependencies to make sure that the Kubernetes client SDKs are the same or later than the versions listed previously. For instructions about how to identify pods that are using stale tokens, see [Kubernetes service accounts](service-accounts.md#identify-pods-using-stale-tokens).
- The Ingress API versions `extensions/v1beta1` and `networking.k8s.io/v1beta1` have been removed in Kubernetes `1.22`. If you're using the [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller), you must upgrade to at least [version `2.4.1`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/releases/tag/v2.4.1) before you upgrade your Amazon EKS clusters to version `1.22`. Additionally, you must modify [Ingress manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/service-resources/ingress-v1/) to use `apiVersion` `networking.k8s.io/v1`. This has been available since [Kubernetes version `1.19`](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/26/kubernetes-release-1.19-accentuate-the-paw-sitive/#ingress-graduates-to-general-availability)). For more information about changes between Ingress `v1beta1` and `v1`, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-guide/#ingress-v122). The AWS Load Balancer Controller [controller sample manifest](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/guide/ingress/spec/) uses the `v1` spec.
- The Amazon EKS legacy [Windows support controllers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/windows-support.html#legacy-windows-support) use the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` API that was removed in Kubernetes `1.22`. If you're running Windows workloads, you must remove legacy [Windows support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/windows-support.html#remove-windows-support-data-plane) and enable [Windows support](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/windows-support.html#enable-windows-support) before upgrading to Amazon EKS version `1.22`.
- The [CertificateSigningRequest (CSR)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/certificate-signing-request-v1) API version `certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1` was removed in Kubernetes version `1.22`. You must migrate manifests and API clients to use the `certificates.k8s.io/v1` CSR API. This API has been available since version `1.19`. For instructions on how to use CSR in Amazon EKS, see [Certificate signing](cert-signing.md).
- The `CustomResourceDefinition` API version `apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1` was removed in Kubernetes `1.22`. Make sure that all custom resource definitions in your cluster are updated to `v1`. API version `v1` custom resource definitions are required to have Open API `v3` schema validation defined. For more information, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/).
- If you're using App Mesh, you must upgrade to at least App Mesh controller `[v1.4.3](https://github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-controller-for-k8s/releases/tag/v1.4.3)` or later before you upgrade to Amazon EKS version `1.22`. Older versions of the App Mesh controller use `v1beta1` `CustomResourceDefinition` API version and aren't compatible with Kubernetes version `1.22` and later.
- Amazon EKS version `1.22` enables the `EndpointSliceTerminatingCondition` feature by default, which includes pods in terminating state within `EndpointSlices`. If you set `enableEndpointSlices` to `True` (the default is disabled) in the AWS Load Balancer Controller, you must upgrade to at least AWS Load Balancer Controller version `2.4.1+` before upgrading to Amazon EKS version `1.22`.
- Starting with Amazon EKS version `1.22`, `kube-proxy` is configured by default to expose Prometheus metrics outside the pod. This behavior change addresses the request made in containers roadmap issue [ #657 ](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/657).
- The initial launch of Amazon EKS version `1.22` uses `etcd` version `3.4` as a backend, and is not affected by the [possibility of data corruption](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/B7gJs88XtQc/m/rSgNOzV2BwAJ?pli=1) present in `etcd` version `3.5`.
- Starting with Amazon EKS `1.22`, Amazon EKS is decoupling AWS cloud specific control logic from core control plane code to the [out-of-tree](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws) AWS Kubernetes [Cloud Controller Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/). This is in line with the upstream Kubernetes recommendation. By decoupling the interoperability logic between Kubernetes and the underlying cloud infrastructure, the `cloud-controller-manager` component enables cloud providers to release features at a different pace compared to the main Kubernetes project. This change is transparent and requires no action. However, a new log stream named `cloud-controller-manager` now appears under the `ControllerManager` log type when enabled. For more information, see [Amazon EKS control plane logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html).
- Starting with Amazon EKS `1.22`, Amazon EKS is changing the default AWS Security Token Service endpoint used by IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA) to be the regional endpoint instead of the global endpoint to reduce latency and improve reliability. You can optionally configure IRSA to use the global endpoint in [Configuring the AWS Security Token Service endpoint for a service account](configure-sts-endpoint.md).

The following Kubernetes features are now supported in Kubernetes `1.22` Amazon EKS clusters:

- **[Server-side Apply graduates to GA](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/)** - Server-side Apply helps users and controllers manage their resources through declarative configurations. It allows them to create or modify objects declaratively by sending their fully specified intent. After being in beta for a couple releases, Server-side Apply is now generally available.
- [Warning mechanism for use of unsupported APIs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1693) - Use of unsupported APIs produces warnings visible to API consumers, and metrics visible to cluster administrators.
