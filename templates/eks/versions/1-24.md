Starting with the Kubernetes version `1.24` launch, officially published Amazon EKS AMIs will include `containerd` as the only runtime. Kubernetes versions lower than `1.24` use Docker as the default runtime. However, these versions have a bootstrap flag option that you can use test out your workloads on any supported cluster with `containerd`. For more information, see [Amazon EKS is ending support for `Dockershim`](dockershim-deprecation.md).
