[`1.21` release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/08/kubernetes-1-21-release-announcement/)

- **Important**
  [https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/542](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/542) graduated to beta and is enabled by default in Kubernetes version `1.21`. This feature improves security of service account tokens by allowing workloads running on Kubernetes to request JSON web tokens that are audience, time, and key bound. Service account tokens now have an expiration of one hour. In previous Kubernetes versions, they didn't have an expiration. This means that clients that rely on these tokens must refresh the tokens within an hour. The following [Kubernetes client SDKs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/) refresh tokens automatically within the required time frame:
  Go version `0.15.7` and later
  Python version `12.0.0` and later
  Java version `9.0.0` and later
  JavaScript version `0.10.3` and later
  Ruby `master` branch
  Haskell version `0.3.0.0`
  C# version `7.0.5` and later
  If your workload is using an older client version, then you must update it. To enable a smooth migration of clients to the newer time-bound service account tokens, Kubernetes version `1.21` adds an extended expiry period to the service account token over the default one hour. For Amazon EKS clusters, the extended expiry period is 90 days. Your Amazon EKS cluster's Kubernetes API server rejects requests with tokens older than 90 days. We recommend that you check your applications and their dependencies to make sure that the Kubernetes client SDKs are the same or later than the versions listed previously. For instructions about how to identify pods that are using stale tokens, see [Kubernetes service accounts](service-accounts.md#identify-pods-using-stale-tokens).
- [Dual-stack networking](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/) support (`IPv4` and `IPv6` addresses) on pods, services, and nodes reached beta status. However, Amazon EKS and the Amazon VPC CNI plugin for Kubernetes don't currently support dual stack networking.
- The Amazon EKS Optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI now contains a bootstrap flag to enable the `containerd` runtime as a Docker alternative. This flag allows preparation for the [removal of Docker as a supported runtime](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/) in the next Kubernetes release. For more information, see [Enable the `containerd` runtime bootstrap flag](eks-optimized-ami.md#containerd-bootstrap). This can be tracked through the [ container roadmap on Github](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/313).
- Managed node groups support for Cluster Autoscaler priority expander.

  Newly created managed node groups on Amazon EKS version `1.21` clusters use the following format for the underlying Auto Scaling group name:

  `eks-managed-node-group-name-uuid`

  This enables using the [priority expander](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/expander/priority/readme.md) feature of Cluster Autoscaler to scale node groups based on user defined priorities. A common use case is to prefer scaling spot node groups over on-demand groups. This behavior change solves the [containers roadmap issue #1304](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/1304).

The following Kubernetes features are now supported in Amazon EKS `1.21` clusters:

- [CronJobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) (previously ScheduledJobs) have now graduated to stable status. With this change, users perform regularly scheduled actions such as backups and report generation.
- [Immutable Secrets and ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-immutable) have now graduated to stable status. A new, immutable field was added to these objects to reject changes. This rejection protects the cluster from updates that can unintentionally break the applications. Because these resources are immutable, `kubelet` doesn't watch or poll for changes. This reduces `kube-apiserver` load and improving scalability and performance.
- [Graceful Node Shutdown](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/21/graceful-node-shutdown-beta/) has now graduated to beta status. With this update, the `kubelet` is aware of node shutdown and can gracefully terminate that node's pods. Before this update, when a node shutdown, its pods didn't follow the expected termination lifecycle. This caused workload problems. Now, the `kubelet` can detect imminent system shutdown through `systemd`, and inform running pods so they terminate gracefully.
- Pods with multiple containers can now use the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container` annotation to have a container preselected for `kubectl` commands.
- `PodSecurityPolicy` is being phased out. `PodSecurityPolicy` will still be functional for several more releases according to Kubernetes deprecation guidelines. For more information, see [PodSecurityPolicy Deprecation: Past, Present, and Future](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future) and the [AWS blog](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-gatekeeper-as-a-drop-in-pod-security-policy-replacement-in-amazon-eks/).
