For more information about Kubernetes `1.19`, see the [official release announcement](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/26/kubernetes-release-1.19-accentuate-the-paw-sitive/)\.

+ Starting with `1.19`, Amazon EKS no longer adds the `kubernetes.io/cluster/my-cluster` tag to subnets passed in when clusters are created\. This subnet tag is only required if you want to influence where the Kubernetes service controller or AWS Load Balancer Controller places Elastic Load Balancers\. For more information about the requirements of subnets passed to Amazon EKS during cluster creation, see updates to [Amazon EKS VPC and subnet requirements and considerations](network_reqs.md)\.
  + Subnet tags aren't modified on existing clusters updated to `1.19`\.
  + The AWS Load Balancer Controller version `2.1.1` and earlier required the *`my-cluster`* subnet tag\. In version `2.1.2` and later, you can specify the tag to refine subnet discovery, but it's not required\. For more information about the AWS Load Balancer Controller, see [Installing the AWS Load Balancer Controller add\-on](aws-load-balancer-controller.md)\. For more information about subnet tagging when using a load balancer, see [Application load balancing on Amazon EKS](alb-ingress.md) and [Network load balancing on Amazon EKS](network-load-balancing.md)\.
+ You're no longer required to provide a security context for non\-root containers that must access the web identity token file for use with IAM roles for service accounts\. For more information, see [IAM roles for service accounts](iam-roles-for-service-accounts.md) and[proposal for file permission handling in projected service account volume](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1598) on GitHub\.
+ The pod identity webhook has been updated to address the [missing startup probes](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook/issues/84) GitHub issue\. The webhook also now supports an annotation to control token expiration\. For more information, see the [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook/pull/97)\.
+ CoreDNS version `1.8.0` is the recommended version for Amazon EKS `1.19` clusters\. This version is installed by default in new Amazon EKS `1.19` clusters\. For more information, see [Managing the CoreDNS add\-on](managing-coredns.md)\.
+ Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMIs include the Linux kernel version `5.4` for Kubernetes version `1.19`\. For more information, see [Changelog](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) on GitHub\.
+ The `CertificateSigningRequest API` has been promoted to stable `certificates.k8s.io/v1` with the following changes:
  + `spec.signerName` is now required\. You can't create requests for `kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown` with the `certificates.k8s.io/v1` API\.
  + You can continue to create CSRs with the `kubernetes.io/legacy-unknown` signer name with the `certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1` API\.
  + You can continue to request that a CSR to is signed for a non\-node server cert, webhooks \(for example, with the `certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1` API\)\. These CSRs aren't auto\-approved\.
  + To approve certificates, a privileged user requires `kubectl` `1.18.8` or later\.

  For more information about the certificate `v1` API, see [Certificate Signing Requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.

The following Amazon EKS Kubernetes resources are critical for the Kubernetes control plane to work\. We recommend that you don't delete or edit them\.


| Permission | Kind | Namespace | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| eks:certificate\-controller | Rolebinding | kube\-system | Impacts signer and approver functionality in the control plane\. |
| eks:certificate\-controller | Role | kube\-system | Impacts signer and approver functionality in the control plane\. |
| eks:certificate\-controller | ClusterRolebinding | All | Impacts kubelet's ability to request server certificates, which affects certain cluster functionality like kubectl exec and kubectl logs\. |

The following Kubernetes features are now supported in Kubernetes `1.19` Amazon EKS clusters:
+ The `ExtendedResourceToleration` admission controller is enabled\. This admission controller automatically adds tolerations for taints to pods requesting extended resources, such as GPUs\. This way, you don't have to manually add the tolerations\. For more information, see [ExtendedResourceToleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#extendedresourcetoleration) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ Elastic Load Balancers \(CLB and NLB\) provisioned by the in\-tree Kubernetes service controller support filtering the nodes included as instance targets\. This can help prevent reaching target group limits in large clusters\. For more information, see the related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/90943) and the `service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-target-node-labels` annotation under [Other ELB annotations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#other-elb-annotations) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ Pod Topology Spread has reached stable status\. You can use topology spread constraints to control how pods are spread across your cluster among failure\-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, and other user\-defined topology domains\. This can help to achieve high availability, as well as efficient resource utilization\. For more information, see [Pod Topology Spread Constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-topology-spread-constraints/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ The Ingress API has reached general availability\. For more information, see [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
+ EndpointSlices are enabled by default\. EndpointSlices are a new API that provides a more scalable and extensible alternative to the Endpoints API for tracking IP addresses, ports, readiness, and topology information for Pods backing a Service\. For more information, see [Scaling Kubernetes Networking With EndpointSlices](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/02/scaling-kubernetes-networking-with-endpointslices/) in the Kubernetes blog\.
+ Secret and ConfigMap volumes can now be marked as immutable\. This significantly reduces load on the API server if there are many Secret and ConfigMap volumes in the cluster\. For more information, see [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) and [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) in the Kubernetes documentation\.
