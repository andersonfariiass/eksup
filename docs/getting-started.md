# Getting Started

Give users a quick tour of how they can get started - both from the perspective of consuming the material provided as well as using the CLI to start evaluating their cluster. This can also double as a reference for how the project is laid out, where information is placed and why, and generally aid future contributors.

1. Start with [preface](preface.md) for the broadly applicable information on upgrading Amazon EKS clusters
2. If you are looking to understand how the project is designed, potentially from the view point of contributing, start with [design](design.md) next.
